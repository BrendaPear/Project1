Was created algorithm that able to match the images in a query set with the images in a much larger data set called gallery. Given some unlabelled training data, the
algorithm will be able to extract its main features and compute the distance between the ones of query images and gallery
images. The expected output is a dictionary having the query image as key and a list of the top n similar gallery pictures associated to it 
thus, having the least distance).
